# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a program designed for version control. Github is a website that utilizes git and allows for collaborative programming on projects.

Researched answer: Git is a free and open-sourced program that provides a version control system and can handle both small and large projects quickly and effectively. Github is a company that provides a cloud-based git repository hosting service. It was designed for the storing, tracking, and collaboration on software projects of all different sizes.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: The Javascript operators that will return a Boolean value are >, <, <=, =>, ==, ===, ||, and &&. 

Researched answer: Within Javascript, there are three operators that will return a boolean value. Those operators are AND, OR, and NOT. They can be used in a variety of ways and are very useful in the construction of complex logic components and flow.

3. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: The index of an array describes the location of a given value within that array. The value of an array is the actual component that occupies a given index within an array.

Researched answer: Each item within an array is referred to as an element. An array can contain many elements of many different datatypes. An index is akin to the address within an array. It can be used to determine the location of a give value within a particular array.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays are much like a list. They are ordered in a particular manner and can store many different datatypes within. A string is a collection of characters that can be arranged in any sort of manner. Both strings and arrays have indices which can be used to reference a specific location within the string or array. The essential difference, however, is that an array can contain any number of datatypes, where as a string may only store characters.

Researched answer: An array is a data structure that is made up of a collection of elements identified by the index. However, a string is a collection of specifically characters. While an index can be utilize to identify a specific character within a string, it is only capable of containing characters, while an array can contain other datatypes.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Proper pair coding involves two people working on the same program or project. They pair consists of a driver and a navigator. At any given time, only one person can occupy the position of the driver or navigator. The navigator conducts the research and directs the driver in the means of typing out the code. The driver's job is to receive the direction of the navigator and type out the code as instructed. While it is imperative that no one attempts to fulfill two roles at once, it is still essential that they work together to identify any potential issues in the program.

Researched answer: Paired programming includes two programmers working on the same program collaboratively. One programmer is the driver, whose job it is to receive direction and type out the code, while the other is the navigator, whose job it is to direct the driver in the aspects of actually typing the code. The number one practice for paired programming is consistent and effective communication between the programmers. It is essential that this be established quickly and effeciently. Secondly, the pair should switch roles between the driver and navigator routinely. This helps to ensure that neither programmer becomes burnt out or overwhelmed. It is also important that the pair submit code frequently. Doing so ensures that few aspects of the program are lost.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A function that operates on other functions. This can be acheived by either taking another function as an argument, or returning another function. This allows us to abstract over actions, where as a regular function only abstracts over values.

2. Jest: A library within Javascript that creates, runs, and structures tests. It is the default choice for projects utilizing React. It allows the user to test their program and locate any potential bugs hidden within the code.

3. Objects: These allow the programmer to store many values within one variable. Rather than having an individual variable for each value, Objects can be used to store related values under one variable. An example would be storing the make, model, and year of a vehicle under one variable, lets say car, rather than having multiple variables storing each of those values separately.

4. Method: Actions within Javascript that can be performed on objects. They can also be referred to as functions that are stored as object properties. They cannot used as constructors and will throw a TypeError if attempted.

5. Classes: Used as a template for the construction of objects. They allow us to encapsulate code that works on data. They are a form of functions and can be defined as a class expression or a class declaration.
